# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
- not confident at all. I don't understand it.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I unproductively struggle. I didn't know what to google seemed like. I this felt really hard.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- all of this really. I think I need to talk or more helpful work thought these examples with a peer or teacher. 


- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I really don't get.
